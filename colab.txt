Getting the model running on colab:

Use google chrome instead of firefox.

Run the following in a codeblock:

!mkdir data
!mkdir data/packaged

After doing this, upload the three .csv/.npz files in data to the data folder. Don't copy the files in data/packaged.

You're going to have to uncomment the data building codeblock, run it, and then comment it out again. Proceed to train the algorithm.

BASE MODEL ASTGCN - 40mins
- I would avoid doing more than 1 epoch.
- Use these if you don't want to run it again:
- training mae/rmse -> 0.02540839173267653/0.0016502609008629979
- testing mae/rmse -> 0.025322685611468776/0.0016213510319142155

Making new models/testing new ones:
- Put them in the .ipynb
- Push to git
- Open main.ipynb in colab
